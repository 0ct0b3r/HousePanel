/*
* House Controller web service PHP application for SmartThings
* author: Ken Washington  (c) 2017
*
* general purpose routines included for authorizing a web service
* specific application shows all switches, motion sensors, and door contacts
* thermostats and doors to open and other capabilities will be added later
* uses Ajax to query specific sensor to return most recent 20 historical events
*
* for switches the Ajax call is used to turn the switch on and off from the web
* DEBUG flags can be used to show specific data details during installation
* this must be paired with a SmartApp on the SmartThings side
* and the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET must match what is specified here
* to do this you must enable OAUTH2 in the SmartApp panel within SmartThings
*
* The endpoints must also match the names referenced in the routines below
* Other requirements for using this web app include installing jquery and pointing to it
* the references below are the directories that I use on my server but they can be anything
* you can even point it to the code.jquery site but I didn't like the delay and security risk
* 
* Finally, install this file and the accompanying .js and .css file on your server
* and you should be good to go. Don't forget to provide the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET info
