<h2>House Panel</h2>

House Panel web service PHP application for SmartThings
author: Ken Washington  (c) 2017

Must be paired with the housemap.groovy SmartApp on the SmartThings side
and the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET must match what is specified here
to do this you must enable OAUTH2 in the SmartApp panel within SmartThings

You must store your CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET information in
a file called clientinfo.php saved to the same directory as this file
it should look as follows but with real data as opposed to this fake data:

<blockquote>
define('CLIENT_ID', 'a1b23aa1-a123-123a-b12c-12345abc1234');
define('CLIENT_SECRET', 'a123456a-bc12-1212-123a-a12312312312');
</blockquote>

<b>Note:</b><br />There is no such file in the shared GitHub repository
To complete the install save all files on your server
and you should be good to go. An options file named hmoptions.cfg 
will be generated when the app first runs and each time any options change
your web server must have write privileges enabled for this to work
